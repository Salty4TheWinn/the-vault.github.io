#[303] The Vault

## About Us

### Where did the name come from?

>Located in Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Vault is an immense maximum security facility designed to hold for superhuman criminals and a specialized wing for extraterrestrial prisoners.
>
> -- [Marvel Wiki](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Vault_(Prison))

We chose this name because the founding members are all friends from Colorado (303 is an area code). Plus it is badass.

### Alliance Mission

We’re here to hit milestones and kick ass. Everyone loves getting awesome alliance rewards. To do this we need to work as a team and maximize results by optimizing everyone’s resources and time. Everyone contributes. Play smarter, not harder. Share knowledge and help others. Lastly, do not forget that it is a game and have fun!

## Rules. Gotta have them.

See [Rule Explanation](#rule-explanations) section below for more detail. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask an Officer.

### General

1. Respect all other members.<sup>1</sup>
2. GroupMe is MANDATORY. It is a free chat app on iOS/Android.<sup>2</sup>
3. Participation is required by everyone on all 3-/5-/7-day events unless notice is given.<sup>3</sup>
4. Participation must stop for an event that is maxed-out.
5. If an event requires participation, do the bare minimum you can contribute, so that all members have a chance to join in.<sup>4</sup>

### Crystals

1. ONLY open crystals if there is a 1- or 3-day event. Period.<sup>5</sup>
2. “Hero” crystals (premium, daily, 2/3/4*) should NOT be opened on 1-day crystal events.<sup>6</sup>
3. 2-star crystals should ONLY be opened on dupe days.<sup>7</sup>

### Rank Up

1. Do NOT rank up unless there is an event. Period.
2. 4* rank ups are NOT allowed on a 1-day event.<sup>8</sup>

### Level Up

1. Do not let your ISO rot away. Level up if you need to anytime.<sup>9

### Alliance Quests

1. Teams/routes should be stable. In the event that you don’t know where to go, please ask.
2. Spectate the quest first and find a person who compliments your team and the path that provides a class advantage. Partner up with them and communicate on GroupMe.
3. Do not join a Quest with a B team. Come prepared with your best champions.
4. No more than 2 players should be on a single path.
5. In the event you are KO’ed, look for the opportunity to unlock unoccupied nodes.<sup>10</sup>

### Rule Explanations

<sup>1</sup>  If/When people make mistakes, learn from them. All members should be encouraging and help one another.  
<sup>2</sup>  In-game chat sucks ass. There is only so much history before it cuts off. We use GroupMe to facilitate communication w/in the alliance. You should be on GroupMe before joining, otherwise you’ll have 24hrs to join. All you have to do is give us your email and you’ll receive an invite.  
<sup>3</sup>  1-day events should have as much participation as possible, but these rewards are not usually worth much effort. Exceptions will be announced via GroupMe.  
<sup>4</sup>  (e.g. rank a 2\*, open a single quest or free crystal). The following day is open season, go nuts.  
<sup>5</sup>  According to Kabam, 7-day crystal events will always be running. You need to save your crystals for overlapping 1- / 3-day events. Basically, only participate in the 7-day event if there is also a 1- / 3-day crystal event running at the same time.  
<sup>6</sup>  1-day event rewards are not worth opening a “hero” crystal for.  
<sup>7</sup>  Chances are extremely high that your 2\* crystal will result in a dupe, because Kabam loves it’s almighty 2\*s.  
<sup>8</sup>  They are way too valuable to waste on a 1-day event.  
<sup>9</sup>  However, if you can save, everyone will appreciate the points you’ll be able to put up in these events.  
<sup>10</sup>  Even though you are KO’d, you can still “leapfrog” other members by staying in front and unlocking the path.  
<sup>11</sup>  Change up your Champion or have your buddy take them out.  
<sup>12</sup>  Try to check in at least every 5 hours (unless you’re sleeping of course) to avoid holding up someone waiting on your node to be cleared.

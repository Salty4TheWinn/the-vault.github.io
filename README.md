We chose this name because the founding members are all friends from Colorado (303 is an area code). Plus it is badass.

####Alliance Mission:

We’re here to hit milestones and kick ass. Everyone loves getting awesome alliance rewards. To do this we need to work as a team and maximize results by optimizing everyone’s resources and time. Everyone contributes. Play smarter, not harder. Share knowledge and help others. Lastly, do not forget that it is a game and have fun!

###Rules. Gotta have them.
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask an Officer.

####General:

1. **Respect all other members - E.L.E.**  
   Everybody Love Everybody. If/When people make mistakes, learn from them. All members should be encouraging and help one another.

2. **GroupMe is MANDATORY.**  
   It is a free chat app on iOS/Android. In-game chat sucks ass. There is only so much history before it cuts off. We use GroupMe to facilitate communication w/in the alliance. You should be on GroupMe before joining, otherwise you’ll have 24hrs to join. All you have to do is give us your email and you’ll receive an invite.

3. **Communicate!**  
   If you know you will miss an event, you need to let everyone know, otherwise you will be held accountable.

4. **Participation is required by everyone on all multi-day events unless notice is given.**  
   1-day events should have as much participation as possible, but these rewards are not usually worth much effort. Exceptions will be announced via GroupMe.

5. **Use Help.**  
   Ask for it, and be sure to give it.

6. **5 days of inactivity = kick**  
   Unless you notify us. We don’t mind if you know you cannot play for a while, just let us know! Otherwise we have no idea when you will be back and it is unfair to the other members.

####Crystals:

1. **ONLY open crystals if there is an event.**  
   Kabam has been changing events a lot lately. Until we can fine-tune the best time to open crystals, you're pretty much free to open them as long as an event is happening.

2. **“Hero” crystals (premium, daily, 2/3/4*) should NOT be opened on 1-day crystal events.**  
   1-day event rewards are not worth opening a “hero” crystal for.

####Rank Up:

1. **Do NOT rank up unless there is an event.**

2. **4* rank ups are NOT allowed on a 1-day event.**  
   They are way too valuable to waste on a 1-day event.

####Duels:
1. **This is a special 1-day event that is required.**  
   This is an exception to the 1-day events. It is an easy event that gives good rewards. If it is a champion event, we find an easy player and post in GroupMe and in-game chat.

####Alliance Quests:

1. **Teams/routes should be stable. In the event that you don’t know where to go, please ask.**

3. **Do not join a Quest with a B team. Come prepared with your best champions.**

4. **No more than 2 players should be on a single path.**

5. **In the event you are KO’ed, look for the opportunity to unlock unoccupied nodes.**  
   Even though you are KO’d, you can still “leapfrog” other members by staying in front and unlocking the path.

6. **Never attack a buffed node.**  
   Just be patient, and wait for the buffing node to be taken out first.

7. **Never attack with a class disadvantage.**  
   Change up your Champion or wait for someone to help you out.

8. **You have a max energy of 5, so use it wisely.**  
   Try to check in at least every 5 hours (unless you’re sleeping of course) to avoid holding up someone waiting on your node to be cleared.

###Infraction Consequences
The following are the consequences of rule violations. 3 strike system.

1. Warning
2. 25k gold donation to the treasury
3. Kicked
